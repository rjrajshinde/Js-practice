    //Closure
    // everything is in outer function is access in the inside function
    // means variable declare in global scope is accessible in local scope is called closure 
    

    //example 1 of closure
    //without passing the arguments still it takes the value its called closure
    var passed = 3;
    var add = function () {
        var no = 3;
        return passed + no;
    }

    console.log(add());

    //example 2 of closure
    var name = 'raj';
    function printname() {
        return name;
    }
    console.log(printname());
    
    //here we change the value of the name
    name = 'king';

    console.log(printname());

    //example 3 of closure
    function one(x) { //fucntion 1
        return function two(y) { //function 2 in function 1
            console.log(x+y);
        }
    }

    //we can call the above function in 2 ways
    //1st way
    let call = one(2);
    call(2);

    //2nd way
    one(2)(2);
